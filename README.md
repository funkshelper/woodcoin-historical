A Funkenstein the Dwarf Presentation: 

============================================

While many dwarfs were content to toil in the mines I have always felt affinity for the forest.  

Now you can chop logs.  

The Woodcoin chain is a log structured database.

The money supply is logarithmic.

The unit is log.

Technical Details:

*RPC Port = 9338

*P2P Ports = 8338 (testnet 18338)

*In Wallet woodcutting = Console, "setgenerate true"

*120 Second Block Target, Diff Retarget every 1 hour

*30 Confirms for spendable-coins

*Block reward = Harmonic Series

1000000/nHeight logs  (after first 100 blocks which form unspendable forest of 5187377 logs) 

*Money Supply = 1000000*(log(nHeight) + gamma)     gamma=Euler-Mascheroni constant 

*New ECDSA curve: X9_62_prime256v1 

*Algo = Pure Skein (double skein) Bruce Schneier is a lumberjack and NSA didn't choose this algo.
