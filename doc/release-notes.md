v1.2 - Officially October 20th, 2015

Many thanks to Dogecoin Core for pioneering the paper wallet paradigm. It's never been very safe to trust the likes of various websites to create paper wallets for us.

This version is not a mandatory upgrade as not fundamental changes are made. It does, however, add a great deal of functinality for regular Woodcoin users, now and in the future. 

Happy 1st Birthday, Woodcoin!
