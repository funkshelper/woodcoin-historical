Description: Logarithmic cryptocurrency made w/Skein.
 Six years ago the great wizard Satoshi Nakamoto delivered middle earth from the clutches of the
 counterfeiters by publicizing the proof of work algorithm in the first implementation of a public
 cryptocurrency: bitcoin. Our current work, woodcoin, is an experimental cryptocurrency
 which is built in much the same way as bitcoin, sharing in the code base with bitcoin and two of
 its successors: litecoin and quark. The objective of woodcoin is to take a very long view and
 design a coin that remains viable and stable extremely far into the future. See Woodcoin.org for
 more information.
